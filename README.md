# **SEO**   !!!!!
<br>
Several SEO techniques were undertaken in order to ensure the site ranks highly in search engine results. Also the files robots.txt and sitemap.xml had been included. The sitemap.xml file had been created using 

[xml-sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

**Keywords:**
<br>
Starting with a brain storm of keywords that are relevant to the e-commerce itself. And reduced by making use of a word search so as to target the more relevant, the site I had used is 

[wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/)


**Content marketing:**
<br>
The information and description of the wares in the site and other sections had been kept the more relevant to the site purpose. Also the keywords had been taken into account when creating things like categories and such, so insure they are present without getting to be considere as spam. 
Each page has its own title, and finally meta tag description had been included in the base so that every page contains them.
